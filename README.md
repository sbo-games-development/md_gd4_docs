# md_gd4_docs

Create Markdown documentation files automatically from Godot 4 projects/docstrings.

As this project still is in early development, parts of the application and/or documentation might be missing or not functional.

More information can be found on [md_gd4_docs - Home (github-pages)](https://sbo-games-development.github.io/md_gd4_docs/)

The documentation is mainly split in two parts:

* [User documentation](https://sbo-games-development.github.io/md_gd4_docs/userdoc): The complete user manual
* [Project documentation](https://sbo-games-development.github.io/md_gd4_docs/src/): Project and source code documentation
